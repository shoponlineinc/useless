      <h1>Hello, My name is <span class="name"></span></h1>
      <h3>I am a <span class="typing"></span></h3>
      <h4> I made this page to write about me and about my works and projects that i made before as if it was a website to show my portfolio and my cv but i was a bit lazy and i did not continue working on it so i am just writing anything here so that i can reach this paragraph to a thousand words because only them i can get accepted by google AdSense which is a website you can use to add ads on your site so that you can gain profit when people view your site and give you page views and i think they pay around a 100 $ per 10,000 page views you get on you site and i am just writing anything here and i also do not  know what i am writing but i am just writing it to fill up this page with any words and anything to just make it reach to one thousand word so ignore whatever you read next ok. So now i want to tell you an amazing story that will make the hair on your head one by one stand from how cool the story is so let's shorten the introduction and directly go into the story. Once upon a time, my mother asked me to buy something for her from the supermarket. So i went to the supermarket and bought the thing that my mother asked me to buy for her and then i came back home and gave the thing to my mother and she told me thank you. How was the story? Did you like it? I do not care. No, I am just kidding if you want to tell me your opinion about the story you still cannot Laugh On Loud is the abbreviation and the short form of LOL Do you understand? I still do not care. Oh My God until now we are still only around 300 words I don’t know what I should write to finish this this is so much and so long anyways let me tell you about my favorite football player. My favorite football player is Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro and he is a very good player and he is also very popular and know. I made in my career of web development around 4 websites 2 of them that are complete websites and one of the other 2 is this one which you are reading in right now I just made it for fun because I was bored and I didn’t have anything to do so I thought why not play around so I am just writing stupid and silly and useless and worthless and anything I can right here in this paragraph and I am really getting bored. I learned programming from the CS50 course if you know it. It is a course made by a teacher and professional programmer and a professor in a university which is very popular in America I think or Britain anyways the name of the university is Harvard University. Ok, Let me tell you another story, why are you even still here and what are you reading man you are wasting your time ok I will tell you something useful now if you want to continue reading and if you do not want to continue reading this useless article I still do not care ok so let me start to tell you the second story for this article on this website with the link named <a href = "https://www.uselesssite1.netlfy.app">uselesssite.netlify.app</a>. Everybody knows that what i am doing right now is to get profit from writing this article and everybody wants to get profit and anyways let me start the story and shorten this very long introduction. Once upon a time, there was a crow which was very thirsty and hungry and after hours and hours of searching he found a long bottle with a very little amount of water at the bottom so he was very happy and he went to the bottle as fast as he could. When he reached to the bottle he tried to drink from the bottle, he tried to put his long peak into the tip of the bottle and he tried every way he could but in the end he wasn’t able to get even a drop of water from the bottle so he was sad and thirsty and hungry now so he decided to try something really smart he found some stones and rocks on the side of the bottle so he said why don’t I try to put the stones in the bottle so the stones rest at the bottom of the water and the water rises up so I can get a few sips of water as I am really thirsty so he started taking stone by stone by stone until he filled up the bottom of the bottle with stones so he went above a medium sized cliff beside the bottle and he tried to take some sips of water and he was so happy but he was still hungry and not completely hydrated he was still thirsty but less than he was before drinking the water. And this was the story I hope you understood it and liked it this story was very good and I can still remember it from my childhood and I really liked It when I was a child because it really taught me that when there is something hard I have to try to work hard to solve it and reach to what I want and what I really need and it also shows that not only human beings are smart and have brains to thing using them but also animals and birds can think and find solutions to problems they face and I really liked this story. This story is taught in schools until now to teach students that they must find solutions for their problems. This was my story thank you for reading and see you never again or maybe if you visit any other website of mine later at any time. Bye!
